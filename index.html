    <h1>Hacker Challenge</h1>

    <p>Use your browser inspector to hack your way through a series of challenges.</p>

    <p>A web inspector is a hidden panel available in all web browsers that allows you to navigate through and temporarily change elements on a page.</p>

    <p>In Google Chrome, you can open your web inspector by right clicking in the browser window and clicking the last option, "Inspect".</p>

    <h2>Useful Inspector Tabs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Once open, you will immediately see the HTML being rendered on the page. This is the "Elements" tab. Use this area to expand and collapse the HTML sections to have a look around.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>The next tab over is the "Console" tab. This shows the logs and errors of the JavaScript that's being rendered on the page. You will see validation, tips, and hints here.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>"Sources" is the next tab over. It'll tell you what files are being loaded into the browser for that page. Here you should see our HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>If you skip over a few advanced tabs, the last tab we will be using is the "Application" tab. Here we will be working with the "Local Storage" area, which shows any data that our website has saved to your browser.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
